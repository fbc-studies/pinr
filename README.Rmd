# pinr

The goal of **pinr** is to simplify working with data containing Finnish
personal identity codes (PINs). You can:

  * Check the validity of or extract information from PINs.
  * Use a heuristic to identify data columns that potentially contain PINs.
  * `pseudonymize()` existing data with a key file without manual joins.

## Installation

Currently you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mikmart/pinr")
```
